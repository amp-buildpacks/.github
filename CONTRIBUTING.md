The Amphitheatre Buildpacks organization welcomes contributions from everyone.
Formally, contributions are given as pull requests for a given repository. To
contribute to a repository, follow the steps below:

## How do I contribute?

1. Fork the repo you'd like to make a contribution to
1. Clone your fork to your local workstation
1. Create a new branch for the issue
1. Make the necessary changes on that branch
1. Commit and push to that branch
1. Make a pull request against the repo
1. Sign the Contributor Licensing Agreement, if necessary

## I've been contributing for a while. How do I join the Amphitheatre Buildpacks organization?

The Amphitheatre organization is divided into teams that are responsible for the
maintenance of some subset of repositories belonging to a particular domain
(e.g. Node.js, Python, Golang).

For each team, there are two tiers of participants:

- Contributors
- Maintainers

### How do I become a contributor?

Becoming a contributor requires a history of interaction with repositories under
a given team's jurisdiction (e.g. `node-engine` repo for the Node.js team).

Once this history has been established, you may self-nominate or be nominated by
an existing contributor or maintainer. Each new contributor must be elected by a
super-majority of the team maintainers.

One way to self-nominate is by creating an issue on the language-family repo for
a given team.

### How do I become a maintainer?

New maintainers must already be contributors, must be nominated by an existing
maintainer, and must be elected by a supermajority of the steering committee.
